<h1 align="center"> DEDSEC_ZIPHITE</h1>
<h4 align="center">DEDSEC_ZIPHITE is a Linux-based tool that injects covert malicious code into a legitimate Python script.</h4>

## DESCRIPTION
DEDSEC_ZIPHITE is capable of rapidly and efficiently injecting malicious code into legitimate Python scripts without requiring root privileges to extract information. This enables it to discreetly harvest sensitive user data, including browser-stored passwords, browsing history, downloads, bookmarks, cookies, host IP address, and username. The injected payload runs silently in the background, evading detection. Additionally, the output of this code is compiled into a binary, further obscuring its presence and making it more difficult to trace.
